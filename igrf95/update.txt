The IGRF95 coefficients on geomag were updated on Sept 21, 1995.
Through correspondence with Charlie Barton at the Australian
Geological Survey it was discovered that a difference in precision
caused a rounding difference for the G 7 6 term, and a misplaced
decimal point caused an error in the H 8 7 term.  The correct
values for these coefficients are:
                G 7 6  10.  [rather than 9.]
                H 8 7 -17.  [rather than -11.]
as reflected on the geomag coefficient set.
