Parameter: Neutral densities and temperature from ground to thermosphere

Brief Description: 

The MSISE model describes the neutral temperature and densities in Earth's
atmosphere from ground to thermospheric heights. Below 72.5 km the model is
primarily based on the MAP Handbook (Labitzke et al., 1985) tabulation of zonal
average temperature and pressure by Barnett and Corney, which was also used for
the CIRA-86. Below 20 km these data were supplemented with averages from the
National Meteorological Center (NMC). In addition, pitot tube, falling sphere,
and grenade sounder rocket measurements from 1947 to 1972 were taken into
consideration. Above 72.5 km MSISE-90 is essentially a revised MSIS-86 model
taking into account data derived from space shuttle flights and newer incoherent
scatter results. For someone interested only in the thermosphere (above 120 km),
the author recommends the MSIS-86 model. MSISE is also not the model of
preference for specialized tropospheric work. It is rather for studies that
reach across several atmospheric boundaries.
